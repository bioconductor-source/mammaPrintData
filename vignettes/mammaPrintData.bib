  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A 70-gene signature was previously shown to have prognostic
	value in patients with node-negative breast cancer. Our goal was
	to validate the signature in an independent group of patients. METHODS:
	Patients (n = 307, with 137 events after a median follow-up of 13.6
	years) from five European centers were divided into high- and low-risk
	groups based on the gene signature classification and on clinical
	risk classifications. Patients were assigned to the gene signature
	low-risk group if their 5-year distant metastasis-free survival probability
	as estimated by the gene signature was greater than 90%. Patients
	were assigned to the clinicopathologic low-risk group if their 10-year
	survival probability, as estimated by Adjuvant! software, was greater
	than 88% (for estrogen receptor [ER]-positive patients) or 92% (for
	ER-negative patients). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to compare
	time to distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall survival
	in high- versus low-risk groups. RESULTS: The 70-gene signature outperformed
	the clinicopathologic risk assessment in predicting all endpoints.
	For time to distant metastases, the gene signature yielded HR = 2.32
	(95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35 to 4.00) without adjustment
	for clinical risk and hazard ratios ranging from 2.13 to 2.15 after
	adjustment for various estimates of clinical risk; clinicopathologic
	risk using Adjuvant! software yielded an unadjusted HR = 1.68 (95%
	CI = 0.92 to 3.07). For overall survival, the gene signature yielded
	an unadjusted HR = 2.79 (95% CI = 1.60 to 4.87) and adjusted hazard
	ratios ranging from 2.63 to 2.89; clinicopathologic risk yielded
	an unadjusted HR = 1.67 (95% CI = 0.93 to 2.98). For patients in
	the gene signature high-risk group, 10-year overall survival was
	0.69 for patients in both the low- and high-clinical risk groups;
	for patients in the gene signature low-risk group, the 10-year survival
	rates were 0.88 and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 70-gene
	signature adds independent prognostic information to clinicopathologic
	risk assessment for patients with early breast cancer.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to molecular classification based on mRNA
	comparisons. Our method, referred to as the top-scoring pair(s) (TSP)

	in using gene expression microarray data for class prediction, for
	example to detect disease, identify tumors or predict treatment response.
	Accurate statistical inference from such data is difficult due to
	the small number of observations, typically tens, relative to the
	large number of genes, typically thousands. Moreover, conventional
	methods from machine learning lead to decisions which are usually
	very difficult to interpret in simple or biologically meaningful
	terms. In contrast, the TSP classifier provides decision rules which
	i) involve very few genes and only relative expression values (e.g.,
	comparing the mRNA counts within a single pair of genes); ii) are
	both accurate and transparent; and iii) provide specific hypotheses
	for follow-up studies. In particular, the TSP classifier achieves
	prediction rates with standard cancer data that are as high as those
	of previous studies which use considerably more genes and complex
	procedures. Finally, the TSP classifier is parameter-free, thus avoiding
	the type of over-fitting and inflated estimates of performance that

	This profile, however, was generated on microarrays containing 25,000

	setting, the 70-gene prognosis profile was translated into a customized
	microarray (MammaPrint) containing a reduced set of 1,900 probes
	suitable for high throughput processing. RNA of 162 patient samples
	from two previous studies was subjected to hybridization to this
	custom array to validate the prognostic value. Classification results
	obtained from the original analysis were then compared to those generated
	using the algorithms based on the custom microarray and showed an
	extremely high correlation of prognosis prediction between the original
	data and those generated using the custom mini-array (p < 0.0001).
	CONCLUSION: In this report we demonstrate for the first time that
	microarray technology can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A major challenge in computational biology is
	to extract knowledge about the genetic nature of disease from high-throughput
	data. However, an important obstacle to both biological understanding
	and clinical applications is the "black box" nature of the decision
	rules provided by most machine learning approaches, which usually
	involve many genes combined in a highly complex fashion. Achieving
	biologically relevant results argues for a different strategy. A
	promising alternative is to base prediction entirely upon the relative
	expression ordering of a small number of genes. RESULTS: We present
	a three-gene version of "relative expression analysis" (RXA), a rigorous
	and systematic comparison with earlier approaches in a variety of
	cancer studies, a clinically relevant application to predicting germline
	BRCA1 mutations in breast cancer and a cross-study validation for
	predicting ER status. In the BRCA1 study, RXA yields high accuracy
	with a simple decision rule: in tumors carrying mutations, the expression
	of a "reference gene" falls between the expression of two differentially
	expressed genes, PPP1CB and RNF14. An analysis of the protein-protein
	interactions among the triplet of genes and BRCA1 suggests that the
	classifier has a biological foundation. CONCLUSIONS: RXA has the
	potential to identify genomic "marker interactions" with plausible
	biological interpretation and direct clinical applicability. It provides
	a general framework for understanding the roles of the genes involved
	in decision rules, as illustrated for the difficult and clinically
	relevant problem of identifying BRCA1 mutation carriers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence that three marketed gene expression-based
	assays improve prognostic accuracy, treatment choice, and health
	outcomes in women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. REVIEW
	METHODS: We evaluated the evidence for three gene expression assays
	on the market; Oncotype DX, MammaPrint and the Breast Cancer Profiling
	(BCP or H/I ratio) test, and for gene expression signatures underlying
	the assays. We sought evidence on: analytic performance of tests,
	clinical validity (i.e., prognostic accuracy and discrimination),
	clinical utility (i.e., prediction of treatment benefit), harms,
	impact on clinical decision making and health care costs. RESULTS:
	Few papers were found on the analytic validity of the Oncotype DX
	and MammaPrint tests, but these showed reasonable within-laboratory
	replicability. Pre-analytic issues related to sample storage and
	preparation may play a larger role than within-laboratory variation.
	For clinical validity, studies differed according to whether they
	examined the actual test that is currently being offered to patients
	or the underlying gene signature. Almost all of the Oncotype DX evidence
	was for the marketed test, the strongest validation study being from
	one arm of a randomized controlled trial (NSABP-14) with a clinically
	homogeneous population. This study showed that the test, added in
	a clinically meaningful manner to standard prognostic indices. The
	MammaPrint signature and test itself was examined in studies with
	clinically heterogeneous populations (e.g., mix of ER positivity
	and tamoxifen treatment) and showed a clinically relevant separation
	of patients into risk categories, but it was not clear exactly how
	many predictions would be shifted across decision thresholds if this
	were used in combination with traditional indices. The BCP test itself
	was examined in one study, and the signature was tested in a variety
	of formulations in several studies. One randomized controlled trial
	provided high quality retrospective evidence of the clinical utility
	of Oncotype DX to predict chemotherapy treatment benefit, but evidence
	for clinical utility was not found for MammaPrint or the H/I ratio.
	Three decision analyses examined the cost-effectiveness of breast
	cancer gene expression assays, and overall were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS:
	Oncotype DX is furthest along the validation pathway, with strong
	retrospective evidence that it predicts distant spread and chemotherapy
	benefit to a clinically relevant extent over standard predictors,
	in a well-defined clinical subgroup with clear treatment implications.
	The evidence for clinical implications of using MammaPrint was not
	as clear as with Oncotype DX, and the ability to predict chemotherapy
	benefit does not yet exist. The H/I ratio test requires further validation.
	For all tests, the relationship of predicted to observed risk in
	different populations still needs further study, as does their incremental
	contribution, optimal implementation, and relevance to patients on
	current therapies.},

	MammaPrint (Agendia BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and H/I (AvariaDX,

	databases (from 1990 through January 2007), Web sites of test manufacturers,
	and discussion with the manufacturers. STUDY SELECTION: Original
	data studies published in English that addressed prognostic accuracy
	and discrimination or treatment benefit prediction of any of the
	3 tests in women with breast cancer. DATA EXTRACTION: Information
	was extracted about the clinical characteristics of the study population
	(particularly clinical and therapeutic homogeneity), tumor characteristics,
	and whether the marketed test or underlying signature was evaluated.
	DATA SYNTHESIS: The tests are based on distinct gene lists, using
	2 different technologies. Overall, the body of evidence showed that
	this new generation of tests may improve prognostic and therapeutic
	prediction, but the tests are at different stages of development.
	Evidence shows that the tests offer clinically relevant, improved
	risk stratification over standard predictors. Oncotype DX has the
	strongest evidence, closely followed by MammaPrint and H/I (which
	is still maturing). LIMITATIONS: For all tests, the relationship
	of predicted to observed risk in different populations and their
	incremental contribution over conventional predictors, optimal implementation,
	and relevance to patients receiving current therapies need further
	study. CONCLUSION: Gene expression technologies show great promise
	to improve predictions of prognosis and treatment benefit for women
	with early-stage breast cancer. More information is needed on the
	extent of improvement in prediction, characteristics of women in
	whom the tests should be used, and how best to incorporate test results

	METHODS: Using microarray analysis to evaluate our previously established

	patients with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression
	signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis.
	All patients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than
	53 years old; 151 had lymph-node-negative disease, and 144 had lymph-node-positive
	disease. We evaluated the predictive power of the prognosis profile
	using univariable and multivariable statistical analyses. RESULTS:
	Among the 295 patients, 180 had a poor-prognosis signature and 115
	had a good-prognosis signature, and the mean (+/-SE) overall 10-year
	survival rates were 54.6+/-4.4 percent and 94.5+/-2.6 percent, respectively.
	At 10 years, the probability of remaining free of distant metastases
	was 50.6+/-4.5 percent in the group with a poor-prognosis signature
	and 85.2+/-4.3 percent in the group with a good-prognosis signature.
	The estimated hazard ratio for distant metastases in the group with
	a poor-prognosis signature, as compared with the group with the good-prognosis
	signature, was 5.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.0; P<0.001).
	This ratio remained significant when the groups were analyzed according
	to lymph-node status. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed
	that the prognosis profile was a strong independent factor in predicting
